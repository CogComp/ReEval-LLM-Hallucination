The ranking of colleges by publications like U.S. News is seen as a scam that doesn't accurately reflect the quality of education or a college's contribution to students and society. The problem lies in the competition among colleges to improve their rankings, which affects their priorities. A group of liberal arts college presidents has decided to no longer participate in the U.S. News survey and create their own method of collecting and reporting data. The rankings themselves can also be arbitrary and can change without notification to readers, causing confusion.\""

In a speech in October 2016, Trump expressed support for capping student loan repayment at 12.5% of borrowers' income and forgiving any remaining debt after fifteen years. He criticized the federal government for profiting from federal student loans and advocated for moving the Office of Civil Rights from the Education Department to the Justice Department. Additionally, Gingrich has proposed abolishing certain courts, including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and defying Supreme Court rulings he disagrees with if elected president. The issue of student loan forgiveness remains a contentious topic in the political landscape."

These innovative technologies harness the power of radioactive nuclei such as polonium or curium to generate electric energy. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient source of power that could be used for humans to live and work on the Moon, as outlined in NASA's plans for a buried reactor with radiators extending into space to dissipate excess heat. The Generation IV International Forum also emphasizes the importance of improving nuclear safety and decreasing costs for future advanced reactor designs. While controlled nuclear fusion plants may offer a long-term solution, they are not currently the main focus of research or development efforts."

In American restaurants, leaving a tip is a common custom, with 4 out of 5 Americans always leaving a tip ranging from 16% to 20% of the total bill."

Abortion is legal in all U.S. states due to the landmark case of \"Roe v. Wade\". However, individual states can regulate or restrict abortion through trigger laws. Currently, 6 states have trigger laws and 3 other states have laws aiming to criminalize abortion. Oklahoma follows the rulings of \"Roe v. Wade\" and \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\", which prohibit placing undue burdens on women seeking abortion. In Ohio, the anti-abortion activist group, Ohio Right to Life, favors incremental restrictions on abortion rather than supporting drastic measures like fetal heartbeat bills."
